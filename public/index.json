Five experiments were conducted in all, and involved various combinations of price (token exchange ratio), wage rate (token production ratio), non-labor income (free tokens), and transaction cost (exchange production ratio). The study found that (1) token accumulation varied inversely with the token production ratio and directly with the exchange-production ratio; (2) token production responses varied inversely with the token production ratio at low ratios but directly at high ratios; (3) token production responses varied directly with the number of free tokens at low amounts but inversely at high amounts; (4) food consumption decreased as the food price increased; and (5) token exchanges increased as the token production ratio decreased.

In the present study, we approached the problem from a behavioraleconomic perspective, using demand-curve methods to analyze demand for, and interactions between, food and social reinforcement. Four rats were given repeated choices between food and 10-s of social access to a familiar rat on concurrent schedules, with social access arranged by lifting a door to a restraint, within which the partner rat was held. The fixed-ratio prices of the food and social interaction were varied, separately or together, generating within-subject demand functions. Demand for both food and social interaction decreased with increases in their own price (ownprice elasticity), though food reinforcers were more robust (higher levels of consumption at the lowest price) and less sensitive to price (less elastic) than was social interaction. Demand for a constant-price of social interaction increased with increases in the price of food (positive cross-price elasticity), suggesting a substitutable relationship. Demand for a constant-price of food did not change with increases in the price of social access, suggesting no reinforcer interaction. Demand for food alone was less elastic than demand for food in the presence of social reinforcement opportunities, showing that value of food is modified by the presence and availability of social reinforcement. The results provide further evidence of the reinforcing value of social interaction, and how it is modified by the broader economic context in which it occurs, including the price and availability of qualitatively different reinforcers of higher value.","tags":null,"title":"Kirkman, C.

Such behavior, clearly beneficial to the second rat and costly to the first, has been interpreted as altruistic. Because clear demonstrations of altruism in rats are rare, such findings deserve a careful look. The present study aimed to replicate this finding, but with more systematic methods to examine whether, and under what conditions, a rat might share food with its cagemate partner. Rats were given repeated choices between high-valued food (sucrose pellets) and 30-s social access to a familiar rat, with the (a) food size (number of food pellets per response), and (b) food motivation (extra-session access to food) varied across conditions. Rats responded consistently for both food and social interaction, but at different levels and with different sensitivity to the food-access manipulations. Food production and consumption was high when food motivation was also high (food restriction) but substantially lower when food motivation was low (unlimited food access). Social release occurred at moderate levels, unaffected by the food-based manipulations. When food was abundant and food motivation low, the rats chose food and social options about equally often, but sharing (food left unconsumed prior to social release) occurred at low levels across sessions and conditions. Even under conditions of low food motivation, sharing occurred on only 1% of the sharing opportunities. The results are therefore inconsistent with claims in the literature that rats are altruistically motivated to share food with other rats.","tags":null,"title":"Wan H., Kirkman, C.
