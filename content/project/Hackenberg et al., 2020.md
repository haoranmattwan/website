Risky and impulsive choice underlie a great number of public health problems, including substance abuse and pathological gambling, to name a few. The main goal of our study is to develop and test an innovative animal model of risky decision making with relevance to addictive processes such as gambling. We are conducting an interrelated series of experiments to quantify the relationships between risky choices and reward variables, economic variables (e.g., real wages and non-labor income), contextual variables (e.g., signals for wins and losses) and social enrichment. We will integrate findings within a larger behavioral economic theoretical framework with implications for prevention and treatment of pathological gambling behavior.
