abstract: Prior research has shown that responding can be maintained under concurrent food and social reinforcement in rats, but little is known about interactions between these reinforcers. In the present study, we approached the problem from a behavioral economic perspective, using demand-curve methods to analyze interactions between food and social reinforcement. Four rats were given repeated choices between food and 10-s of social access to a familiar rat on concurrent schedules. Social access was arranged by lifting a door to a restraint, within which the partner rat was held. In Phase 1, the price of social access was held constant at fixed ratio (FR) 1 across all conditions, while the price of food was systematically increased from FR 1 to FR 64. In Phase 2, the price of food was held constant at FR 1 across conditions, while the price of social access was systematically increased from FR 1 to FR 64. Production of both food and social reinforcers decreased with increases in their own price (own-price elasticity), and increased with increases in the price of the other reinforcer (cross-price elasticity), suggesting a substitutable relationship. The methods show promise as a way to quantify interactions between qualitatively different reinforcers.
