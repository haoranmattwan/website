abstract: Rats were given repeated choices between food and 30-s social access to a familiar rat, with the amount, location, and availability of food systematically manipulated across conditions. Social access was arranged by lifting a door to a restraint, within which the partner rat was held. Of primary interest was if, and under what conditions, rats would share food with the partner rat, operationally defined as a sequence of responses, consisting of (a) producing food; (b) producing social release; and (c) with food remaining in the receptacle, permitting food consumption by the partner rat. Consistent responding was maintained for access to both reinforcers across a series of conditions designed to vary the motivational value of food (varying the number of pellets per response and homecage food access). Responding for social access tended to occur later in the session, following high levels of food consumption, but sharing rarely occurred (<1% pellets produced), even with very rich schedules (5 pellets under FR1) and no food restriction outside the sessions. Taken as a whole, the present results cast doubt on claims in the literature that rats are motivated by empathy to share food with other rats.
