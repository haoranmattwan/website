abstract: This study examined pigeonsâ€™ behavior in a token economy from an economic perspective. Five experiments were conducted in all, examining various combinations of token-exchange ratio, token-production ratio, (free) non-labor tokens, and exchange-production ratio. We found that (1) token accumulation varied inversely with the token-production ratio and directly with the exchange-production ratio; (2) token production responses varied inversely with the token-production ratio at low ratios but directly at high ratios; (3) token production responses varied directly with the number of non-labor tokens at low amounts but inversely at high amounts; and (4) food consumption decreased as food prices increased. This study contributes to an economic understanding of behavior in a token economy, using concepts of consumer demand and labor supply.
