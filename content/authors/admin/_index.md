I'm a behavioral psychologist with focuses on discounting and behavioral economics. I am currently working in [Behavioral Economics Lab](https://sites.wustl.edu/lengreen/) under the direction of Dr. Leonard Green as a 2nd year graduate student in the Behavior, Brain, & Cognition program at Washington University in St. Louis. I completed my BA in Psychology-Economics at Reed College, where I worked as a research assistant at [Learning & Adaptive Behavior Laboratory](https://www.reed.edu/psychology/adaptive-behavior/) under the direction of Dr. Timothy Hackenberg.
